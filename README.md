# Predict App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install dependencies

### `npm run dev`

Runs parallel the React app and the API.

### `npm start`

Runs React app.

### `npm run api`

Runs API.

## Notes

- React Context was chosen for its suitability in rapid prototyping.

- The current implementation of the store relies on filenames and requires improvements to handle multiple directories more effectively.

- To streamline configuration, a single CSS file is utilized throughout the project.

- Further enhancements can be made to the current implementation of the API hook and the image resizer for improved functionality.

- Tested in newest Chrome and Firefox with responsive mode.
